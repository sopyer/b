      <description>In previous blog post I presented simple Vulkan program, which was mostly initialization/deinitialization sequences. I replaced rendering with simple clear. In this blog post I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how to do actual rendering. I thought that simple triangle will be too boring, so instead I decided to illustrate shaders with primitive raytracing example from ShaderToy.
Also first I want to list few interesting Vulkan articles, which I encountered since last time:</description>

      <description>For a long time I wanted to start learning new low-level API like DirectX and Vulkan. And I procrastinated, as my current job is barely related to rendering and there is little interest in high performance code and high performance rendering specifically. Recently I decided instead of just writing code myself to document my learning exercises in hope that they will be useful to other people. As a side effect I hope it will help with my motivation.</description>
